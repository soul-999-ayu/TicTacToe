## Notes
This is an initial release of the game and the code and it may contain some issues.

~~The code contains some functions and comments that are useless for now but they'll be used in the next version.~~

## Future plans
~~I'll add bot mode in the game and will improve the Ui so that it will look cool as well as bug free.~~

I'll add a "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" bot mode.

## Conclusion
The code is short and easy to understand and has bot mode as well as two player mode. Kindly check our other repositories too.
